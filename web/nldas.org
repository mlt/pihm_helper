* Setting things up

For historical reasons a shapefile with reference grid is needed for
this tool to work.
# The reference grid is made after [[http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/dods/NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002.info][NLDAS-2 metadata]].

Skip these steps and jump to [[Usage]] if you already have that.

1. Start Vector\to Research Tools\to Vector grid
2. Enter extent as in [[http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/dods/NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002.info][NLDAS-2 metadata]] taking into account that those
   given for centroids.\\
   So use (-124.938 - 0.0625, 25.063 - 0.0625) --- (-67.063 + 0.0625, 52.938 + 0.0625)\\
   or (-125.0005, 25.0005) --- (-67.0005, 53.0005)\\

3. Open Attribute Table and toggle editing mode (=Ctrl+E=)
4. Using field Calculator (=Ctrl+I=) set 1 based indices
   - NLDAS\_X :: =toint( ( "XMIN" - (-124.938 - 0.0625) ) / 0.125) + 1=
   - NLDAS\_Y :: =toint( ( "YMIN" - (25.063 - 0.0625) ) / 0.125) + 1=\\

   [[./images/nldas_2_nldas_x.PNG]]
5. Create text field =NLDAS_ID= by concatenating 'x' || "NLDAS\_X" || 'y' || "NLDAS\_Y" .\\
   Remember to use /text/ output field type.
6. Quit editing mode saving changes
7. Set layer coordinate reference system (CRS) to WGS84 if not
   assigned yet

Note that there a bugs in Vector Grid plug-in that are fixed in QGIS
2.0 so your mileage may vary:
1. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6109
2. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6124

Perhaps it is easier to [[./nldas_reference.zip][download existing one]].

* Usage

There are 3 entry points to extractor:

- Command Line Interface
- Standalone GUI
- QGIS plug-in

All interfaces require vector data in WGS84 to define spatial
coverage. Therefore proper CRS needs to be assigned to the existing
layer and it must be saved in WGS84 accordingly.

#+CAPTION: Save vector layer in WGS84

It should look something like

#+CAPTION: QGIS overview
[[./images/nldas_5_qgis.PNG]]

if you enabled labeling based on /NLDAS\_ID/. Now you can select
necessary cells by locations using Vector\to Research Tools\to Select by location

#+CAPTION: Select by location
[[./images/nldas_6_select.PNG]]

Now you can either save selection and use standalone versions, or jump
to [[QGIS plugin]]

Make sure that you have all the necessary python modules and that Qt
shared objects can be found. For instance the following batch file can
be used on MS Windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
@echo off
set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W
set PYTHONPATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\python;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\python\plugins;%HOME%/.qgis/python/plugins;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\python27\lib\site-packages
set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\plugins
python nldas_extractor_gui.py %*
#+END_SRC

** QGIS plugin

Once you have selected cells of interest, you can use Plugin\to PIHM
helper\to DataModel Loader\to Extract NLDAS-2
or simply hit =Alt+A, N=

Note that there is an [[http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-July/021252.html][issue]] with python threads therefore a workaround
is used for plug-in to be still usable.
